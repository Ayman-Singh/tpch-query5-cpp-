# TPCH Query 5 C++ Implementation


Navigate to `~/tpch-query5/src` where the executable `tpch_query5`  is there.

## Compilation

```bash
cd ~/tpch-query5/src
g++ -std=c++17 -I../include main.cpp query5.cpp -o tpch_query5
````

## Execution

### Multithreaded (4 Threads)

```bash
cd ~/tpch-query5/src
./tpch_query5 \
  --r_name ASIA \
  --start_date 1994-01-01 \
  --end_date   1995-01-01 \
  --threads    4 \
  --table_path ../build/tpch-dbgen \
  --result_path ../build/results/result.txt
```


## Performance Comparison

Below are screenshots of the query running in single-thread and multi-thread modes, to compare the parallelism in executeQuery5 function

#### Single-Threaded Run

Avereage execution time observed was around 26 sec

#### Multi-Threaded Run
Whereas it boiled down to 11 seconds when using 4 threads
